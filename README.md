# Python-Learning
code I write as I progress through modules in online courses. Markdown titles are included to separate learning sections but the format is messy and acts as scratch paper for my own benefit. It is possible to view many errors where I was either stuck on something or went on exploratory tangents. There are either no or minimal comments.
